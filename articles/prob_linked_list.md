========================
Problem: Implement a function to reverse a linked list, and return
the head of the reversed list. A list node is defined as below:
<pre class="prettyprint">
struct ListNode { 
   int       m_nKey; 
   ListNode* m_pNext; 
};
</pre>


[delete a node in middle](http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/data-structures/delete-a-node-in-the-middle-of-a-singly-linked-list/)
========================
How would you write a function to delete a node in the middle of a
singly linked list? Assume that the only thing you get access to in
the function is the node that needs to be deleted. We also want to
reconstruct the linked list so that all of the node pointers are in
place even after the deletion.

+ each node contains a value pointer pointing to a node, duplicate LL.
+ remove duplicates from sorted/un-sorted LL.
+ find n-th to last node to end
+ number is represented by LL, add 2 numbers
